      '\nForeign companies doing business in Southeast Asia or considering it are attracted to Vietnam’s skilled labor force, a survey by HSBC has found.\t\nThe survey polled over 1,500 key decision-makers in companies running businesses with a turnover of at least US$5 million in six countries -- China, India, the UK, France, Germany and the U.S. -- in March.\nThree in 10 said Vietnam’s skilled workforce is the most attractive feature.\nThe country’s optimistic economic outlook, competitive wages and resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic were all also seen as attractive, with 27 percent of respondents mentioning them.\nThirty six percent of U.S. companies were attracted by the opportunity Vietnam offers to test and develop new products or solutions, and 33 percent liked the country’s favorable regulations.\nIndian firms were attracted by Vietnam’s supportive government and regulatory environment (49 percent) and infrastructure (39 percent).\nGerman companies were attracted by supply chain ease and social and political stability, with a quarter of the respondents mentioning them.\nThirty percent of the French were particularly attracted by the optimistic outlook of the economy.\nTim Evans, general director of HSBC Vietnam, said the country is on its way to becoming one of the world’s manufacturing centers, thanks to its solid fundamentals and attractiveness for international investors.\nGlobal businesses shifting to Vietnam is "not a temporary, but a long-term strategy," he added.\nBut the disruptive impact of the pandemic, and the challenges in adapting to contemporary sustainability requirements were the top issues faced by international businesses with operations in Vietnam.\nInterestingly, despite the geological proximity, Chinese companies were over twice as likely to raise culture as an issue for operating in Vietnam than those from the UK.\nSome 31 percent of respondents said they worry about new regulations and rules on carbon reduction following Vietnam’s commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nThree in 10 firms said they need to improve their internal sustainability expertise, but 36 percent flagged the difficulty of hiring employees with the suitable sustainability credentials and knowledge.',

      '\nThere are 300,000 real estate brokers but only 10 percent have licenses, according to data from the Vietnam Association of Realtors.\t\nThe association said most of the unlicensed brokers are amateurs, and include people who decided to change jobs recently to take advantage of the real estate boom.\nThey are untrained and unregulated, and analysts fear they pose a risk to buyers, sellers and the market as a whole, with some also blaming them for causing market disruptions and price bubbles by spreading rumors about development.\nThe actual ratio of unlicensed brokers could be even higher since the study was only done at the association’s 300 member companies.\nAt least 1,000 companies were operating before Covid-19.\nMeanwhile, the number of applications for real estate broker licenses in the south has surged by eight times this year, with 2,186 people taking the broker’s examination in the first five months this year compared to 275 last year , according to data from the Ho Chi Minh City Construction College.\nThe government made licenses compulsory in July 2015, and all licenses issued before that were effective until 2021, said Luong Dinh Thu Van, CEO of real estate training facility Mogin Institute in HCMC\'s District 1.\n"Because of Covid-19 last year many people could not take the examination for a new license."\nBrokers who conduct business without a license could be fined VND60 million ($2,600), she said.\nThe HCC has recommended setting up a portal for verifying broker’s credentials to improve transparency in the real estate market.\nIt also suggested letting those having beginner certificates and more than a year of experience take the broker’s examination, and scrap the requirement of a high school degree.\nEasing eligibility would help independent brokers practice professionally in compliance with laws and regulations, it added.',

Online scammers have a tendency to set up multiple malicious websites on one server, sometimes in the hundreds."\nEarlier a click to earn app called CryptoBike was accused of scamming users to the tune of $1.4 million.\nSleepN, a sleep to earn app that attracted the crypto community\'s attention, turned out to be a joke.\n"Many apps are ponzi schemes in disguise, trying to scam new investors," Dinh said.\nUsers should research the market to avoid dubious apps, analysts said.\nIn the past it was not uncommon for blockchain developers to stay anonymous, but many have decided to come out to demonstrate their projects’ legitimacy following many scams.\nIt is imperative that users find out about the development team before deciding to invest, Dinh said.\nHe pointed out that move to earn scams are not confined to Vietnam but also plague more developed markets like the U.S. and Europe.',

    content:
      "\nPrivate investors are showing more interest in building expressways after a long thaw, with experts calling for greater support from the government and relevant localities.\t\nVietnam’s biggest conglomerate Vingroup and largest private lender Techcombank have been given the green light to conduct a pre-feasibility study on the Gia Nghia - Chon Thanh expressway.\nThe consortium will have to submit its report by Aug. 31, according to the Ministry of Transport (MoT).\nOnce the report is appraised and approved, the MoT will start a bid to select investors for the expressway, with Vingroup-Techcombank able to participate in the process should they want to.\nThe expressway will stretch 212 kilometers with four-six lanes and a maximum speed of 80-100 kph. It will connect Central Highland Dak Nong and southern Binh Phuoc provinces.\nAnother consortium, led by Deo Ca Corporation, has proposed to invest in two expressway projects in the north, Dong Dang - Tra Linh and Huu Nghi - Lang Son.\nIt commits to raise VND2.7 trillion for the project.\nThe 115-kilometer Dong Dang - Tra Linh expressway will connect Lang Son and Cao Bang provinces, while the 43-kilometer Huu Nghi - Chi Lang will run from Lang Son to the border with China.\nFirst-phase investment for the former is expected to be VND13.2 trillion, and for the latter, VND7.61 trillion. They have yet to attract investors, and have been delayed due to low traffic volume and shortage of capital.\nIn early May, the Civil Engineering Construction Corporation No. 6 (CIENCO 6), together with Coteccons Construction, Thuan Viet Construction & Investment, and Tan Thanh Holdings Investment, had notified the MoT about their interest in investing in the Bien Hoa - Vung Tau expressway.\nThe government has approved the project’s pre-feasible report, with first-phase investment of VND17.83 trillion. However, it later proposed to shift the investment model from public-private partnership (PPP) to public investment.\nThe change would shorten the project’s completion time to 2025 rather than 2026, as the bidding process under the PPP model would not finish until March 2024, the MoT said.\nTran Chung, chairman of the Vietnamese Association of Road Systems Investors, said it is a good sign that many private companies are seeking to invest in expressways.\nThose projects were not able to attract private investors, as they only funded three out of eight expressways between 2017 and 2020.\nThe current PPP Law includes clarified rights and obligations pertaining to related parties, but there is a remaining bottleneck: the state's capital contribution needs to be lower than 50 percent of total investment.\nInvestors of projects in remote areas will be discouraged due to this regulation, he said. Those projects will have low traffic volume and a long payback period, so it is necessary for the government to raise financial aid toward these.\nInvestors are further concerned over the risk- and profit-sharing mechanism, with the government and localities required to commit to disbursing capital and clearing construction sites on schedule.",

      "\nS&P Global Ratings has upgraded Vietnam’s currency sovereign credit ratings to ‘BB+’ with a stable outlook, demonstrating that Vietnam’s economy would keep recovering from Covid impacts.\t\n\"We raised our sovereign ratings on Vietnam to reflect our view of improvements in the government's administrative processes,\" S&P stated Thursday.\nIn recent years, the government had implemented measures that helped close the gap on lapses in repaying guaranteed debt.\nThe ratings upgrade is also supported by Vietnam's robust economic prospects and sound external position. Vietnam continued to attract strong foreign direct investment (FDI) flows, despite pandemic disruptions.\n\"We expect export-led growth and strong investment to keep the economy's trend growth rate well above the average of its peers,\" S&P said.\nVietnam's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita has risen quickly in the past few years from a relatively low base, and the ratings agency expects GDP per capita in 2022 to reach $3,868, against the country’s target of $3,900.\nS&P forecasts GDP growth to hit 6.9 percent this year (compared to 2.6 percent last year), adding that the country would likely grow 6.5-7 percent from 2023 onward.\n\"Vietnam's attractiveness as a premier destination for foreign direct investment in Southeast Asia, along with its young, increasingly educated, and competitive workforce, should help keep the country's long-term development trajectory intact despite temporary labor market disruptions from Covid-induced lockdowns.\"\nBut the ratings agency said that risks to economic growth are tilted toward the downside, because Vietnam's export-led economy relies on strong external demand.\nRising inflation and financing conditions, as well as geopolitical risks, could dampen global growth and reduce demand for Vietnamese exports, it added.",

Some cling to a belief that it is just too big to fail.\nTran Trung of the southern Binh Phuoc Province also sold a part of his cryptocurrency portfolio to raise $1,000. He invested that in UST at $0.1 after reading news about its developer trying to save the coin from falling.\n"My account could rise 10-fold if it hits the peg of $1," he said.\nBut UST has yet to show any signs of recovery and is trading at around $0.08-0.09.\nMany investors have been flocking to Luna and UST after they crashed on May 12, with some boasting on social media about making hundreds, even thousands, of dollars on an investment of less than a hundred dollars.\nBut others have lost big by betting on them.\n"Many fear missing out once a token collapses and try to benefit from bottom fishing," Anh Bang, the administrator of a Facebook group on cryptocurrencies, said.\n"The more they piled on, the more they lost."\nHe also questioned the wisdom of selling large-cap coins to invest in volatile tokens.',

      '\nMany auto brands have no luxury cars to supply Vietnamese customers due to global semiconductor shortage.\t\nTrung Kien, 33, from the northern province of Bac Ninh, said he has been looking for a luxury car with a price tag of around VND7 billion ($300,000) for a month, but found nothing to buy.\nHe said he would have to wait for three to six months to get a popular luxury car delivered, due to shortage of components, especially semiconductors and chips.\nOver the last two years, supply from the world\'s largest producer, China, has been trickling due to impacts of Covid-19, resulting in a global shortage.\nSupply of luxury cars in Vietnam is hit the hardest, as brands focus on delivering orders to their major markets like the U.S. or European countries.\nMercedes-Benz customers are said to wait for at least three months for some SUVs and S-class sedans, and up to a year for the ultra-luxury Maybach sedans and SUVs.\nSome locally made models, including E-class sedans and GLC SUVs, are also in short supply, so buyers will have to wait 1-2 months to get their unit delivered.\nMany auto dealers are accepting deposits but not promising when they can deliver cars.\nVinh Nam, an experienced luxury car salesperson in HCMC, said customers have gotten used to the current shortage.\n"They prioritize getting a car rather than a color of choice and other options".\nBMW used to have a fairly steady supply despite having to import vehicles, but in recent months supply has declined and buyers have to wait three to six months for delivery.\nBuyers of Porsche, Lexus and Land Rover have the longest waiting time of 12-14 months depending on their choice of color and options, up from the earlier six to nine months.\nMany buyers are impatient and as a result are not making deposits with dealers, while some are turning to the gray market.\nThe shortage of auto parts is also hurting buyers, with some brands raising their prices and cutting promotions.\nSome models are being sold at above listed prices. A Land Cruiser LC300, for instance, is being offered at VND5.5 billion, 37.5 percent higher than the original price.',

      '\nVietnam needs to study the possibility of restarting its nuclear power projects to achieve the net zero emission target it has committed to reach by 2050, lawmakers say.\t\nMany countries have recognized nuclear power as a clean type of energy with low greenhouse gas emissions after the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the National Assembly’s Economic Committee says in a report.\nVietnam therefore should consider reviving its plans to develop nuclear energy to ensure energy security and independent economic development, it says.\nTo make this happen, the Party should approve the move and the government should then consider restarting the Ninh Thuan Nuclear Power Project at an appropriate time.\nThe National Assembly had shut down Vietnam’s first nuclear power project in 2016, saying the nation could not afford it then.\nBy that time seven sub-projects had begun implementation with a total investment of over VND2.3 trillion ($99.01 million), and nearly 450 students and engineers were being trained by Russian and Japanese experts.\nThe original plan was to have two multi-billion-dollar nuclear power plants in the central province of Ninh Thuan.\nThe National Assembly committee is proposing now that the government should keep clear the land proposed for the plants until a final decision is made, because selecting the right location for nuclear projects is a long and costly process.\nThe report says that if the Ninh Thuan project is scrapped completely, Vietnam would have a hard time developing this technology in the future and relationships with partner countries would suffer.\nSeveral experts have also called for reviving nuclear energy development plans in Vietnam to meet demands of a growing economy.\n"Restarting the nuclear power program by 2030 is the only way to achieve our net-zero carbon commitment by 2050 (as committed at COP26)," former head of the Vietnam Institute of Energy Nguyen Manh Hien said last month.\nTran Chi Thanh, head of Vietnam Atomic Energy Institute, has also said that the nuclear energy program "must restart soon."',

      '\nVietnam\'s VinFast is shifting its legal and financial headquarters to Singapore as the fledgling electric vehicle (EV) maker readies for a potential public listing and the first production run of cars for U.S. and European markets, its chief executive told Reuters.\t\nThe three-year-old unit of conglomerate Vingroup JSC will start building its VF8 sport utility vehicle (SUV) next week, its own EV batteries in August, and a $4 billion U.S. factory by summer-end, Le Thi Thu Thuy said in an interview.\nVinFast has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States through a Singapore-based holding company - though market conditions might push the deal into 2023, Vingroup Chairman Pham Nhat Vuong said earlier this month.\nThuy declined to comment about the IPO when asked, but said the company\'s EV expansion plans were not contingent on the listing. "Like any big corporate, we always consider all potential financing transactions," Thuy said.\nThe CEO said she planned to spend more time in Singapore, where VinFast is buying a building, turning its holding company into an operating hub that would include an office and housing for staff and executives.\n"We feel that Singapore is a jurisdiction that will give investors more confidence," Thuy said. "We put ourselves in the shoes of the investors."\nWhile Thuy did not elaborate further, Singapore is widely seen as the most developed market in Southeast Asia, with a strong regulatory framework, mature financial services sector and access to arbitration.\nParent Vingroup is Vietnam\'s largest listed company by market capitalisation, with businesses in retail, real estate and resorts. It created VinFast in 2019 to build conventional petrol-powered cars before switching exclusively to EVs in 2021.\nThough the market is crowded with established automakers vying with a range of startups, Vingroup in May still said it saw a global EV shortage which it deemed a "golden chance".\nWith a local line-up of just one small EV, the e34, VinFast has invested heavily to develop models for overseas.\nAlongside its VF8, it has also been developing the larger VF9, though that was delayed by about a month because of the impact of Covid-19 containment measures in Shanghai on suppliers, Thuy said.\n"We will deliver cars to the international market by the end of the year," Thuy said, starting with the VF8. "All of our effort is on the start of production for the VF8."\nVinFast is particularly betting on the U.S. market, where it hopes to sell the two SUVs with prices from about $41,000 with a battery leasing plan. It aims to open its first showrooms in California by early July, including a flagship site in Santa Monica, Thuy said.\nThe automaker also plans to build a plant in North Carolina where it is seeking government financing, with construction starting by summer-end and production beginning in 2024.\nVinFast\'s first VF8 models will be powered by batteries from South Korea\'s Samsung SDI Co Ltd, but the automaker has been developing its own batteries as a hedge against future shortages, Thuy said.\nVinFast will start making the batteries in August and expects to have the capacity to produce about 3,000 vehicles with its own batteries by year-end, she said.\nThrough April, the company had sold 9,155 cars in its home market, mostly the internal-combustion models it is phasing out. It has sold 996 EVs since launching the e34 in Vietnam.\nThe company is also in the process of expanding its existing plant in Haiphong, Vietnam and expects to be able to produce 820,000 vehicles annually there by 2025, Thuy said. The company will retain its operational headquarters in Vietnam, a spokesman said.',

      '\nOn an overcast morning in Bradford, northern England, a steady stream of locals arrive at a foodbank to collect produce parcels described as "a lifesaver" during the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.\t\nBradford Central Foodbank is helping twice as many people compared to pre-pandemic, as spiralling prices for energy, food and other basics leave a growing number of Britons struggling.\n"The numbers since I\'ve been a volunteer have only multiplied and I can only see it getting worse," said Karl Carroll, 33, who has relied on the parcels since 2019 and is now volunteering at the foodbank.\n"I\'ve barely got £40 ($50, 47 euros) by the time I\'ve paid everything out, so I imagine families are struggling in more ways," he told AFP.\nSimon Jackson, 43, an unemployed former supermarket worker who is accessing long-term government sickness benefits, has been a foodbank user since February.\n"It is a tougher time at the minute... the cost of living\'s skyrocketed to a point of we\'re having to use foodbanks a bit more," he said.\nJackson currently gets around £900 a month in various government support payments but, like Carroll, once his bills are paid, there is little left over for food.\nRising prices are exacerbating the situation.\n"Places like (this) here in Bradford are a lifesaver. They can really help balance your decisions -- sometimes between the heating and eating," he said.\nSurvival\nOne of the clearest signs of the crisis is the surge in foodbank use.\nThe Trussell Trust charity says its more than 1,400 affiliated sites handed out 2.1 million parcels in the past year -- 830,000 of them to children -- in a 14 percent increase on pre-pandemic levels.\nIts central Bradford operation is hosted three days a week by a local church organisation, and can supply people with only three parcels within six months to manage demand.\nThey contain basics such as cereal, tinned soup, meat and fish, pasta, sauces, vegetables, biscuits, sugar, tea and coffee.\nStarted in 2011, it is one of around 30 free food providers now in the city of just over half a million residents, and currently helps around 1,000 people a month, said manager Josie Barlow.\nGreater Bradford\'s population -- the sixth biggest metropolitan area in England -- is the fifth most income-deprived and sixth most employment-deprived nationwide, according to the government\'s last poverty index published in 2019.\nThat leaves it particularly vulnerable in the current climate.\n"It\'s people that are on the lowest incomes that\'ll suffer the most... they have to buy the essentials but they\'re the things that are really going up by a lot," Barlow explained.\nShe greets arrivals with a warm smile and upbeat energy, directing them to collection tables as well as welfare, housing and other advisors.\n"We want to give a food parcel, but we also really want to help people with the root causes of their food crisis," Barlow noted.\nShe said they receive "a whole spread of society", which includes working as well as unemployed people.\n"You do a budget with people and you\'re like: \'yeah, you just can\'t live on that, can you?\' And there\'s no real way out of that," she added.\n"You can\'t expect people to live like that, in crisis, just trying to survive in the long-term."\nWinter fears\nThe government announced Thursday a new £15 billion support package aimed at the most vulnerable, ahead of an expected 42 percent jump in energy bills in October -- which follows a 54 percent hike last month.\nThree-quarters of the money is directed at government benefits recipients, with a £650 "cost-of-living payment" to most alongside £300 for pensioners and an extra £150 for those on disability support.\nBut in Bradford, as elsewhere, it cannot allay fears that worse to come.\nThe current nine percent inflation rate is predicted to surge even higher, which would swamp any additional support.\n"I\'m quite scared by this winter coming up," admitted Barlow, noting summer allows people to get by without heating.\n"Come this winter, when you really do need it on... I just don\'t know how people are going to survive."\nJackson predicted the biggest squeeze could come at Christmas, as families in particular grapple with giving presents as well as putting food on the table.\n"It might not be so much for me, because I\'m on my own -- I\'ll just put an extra blanket on or something," he said.\n"But for those with small kids that have Christmas presents and other needs... it\'s really going to be tough."\nSimone Hillhands, 34, is one. She has three children aged 10, 13 and 15. One of them has a disability, which prevents her from working full time.\nHer children\'s school directed her to the foodbank.\n"I need to care for them," she explained.\nReluctant to reveal too much of her personal circumstances, Hillhands confided that her sister had recently been made homeless and the wider family\'s situation was "really, really hard" with prices rising.\n"They\'ve gone through the roof... it\'s crazy!" she said, adding that despite the pandemic, "last year was a lot easier".',

      "\nStriking union workers at Chevron Corp's Richmond, California, refinery voted on Saturday to ratify the latest contract offered by the company, ending a 10-week strike without achieving their goal of additional pay to counter rising health care costs, said sources familiar with the vote.\t\nThe USW filed charges on May 13 against Chevron with the U.S. National Labor Relations Board alleging the company had changed the terms of employment, engaged in coercive actions, including surveillance, and refused to bargain with the union.\nChevron has kept the refinery in operation with managers, supervisors and workers who crossed the picket line.",
